This Repo provides an App implementation to the testing task (Build a single EPG screen native Android app). The app requests data from the Mock-API @ http://localhost:1337/epg. By default, localhost means the IP of your development host machine in which you are running the app via emulator (10.0.2.2). If the base API URL needs to be changed, you have to go to gradle.properties file and change the EPG_BASE_URL field to the desired one.
